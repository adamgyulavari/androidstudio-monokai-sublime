## Sublime Monokai Color Theme for Android Studio
### THIS IS A FORK FROM https://github.com/OtaK/jetbrains-monokai-sublime
#### This color scheme based on 0tak's version to fit well on Android Studio's Java, XML, Groovy

This is a port of the Monokai theme from Sublime Text 2 to IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs. In __Android Studio Preview 2.0 Beta 7__ with __Drakula Theme__, it looks like this:

## What to see? What is different?
  - Blue background is selection
  - Yellow background is warning
  - Gradle is readable

## Motivation and contribution
  - I've tried more than a dozen monokai schemes for IntelliJ based IDEs, and this was the closest to what I had in mind
  - There were still a few things though with not good enough visibility
  - This should be the thing that works for android developers in Studio without any modification
  - If you find something to change and you're using this for Android Studio, pls do it and create a PR :)

## Installation
  - Download MonokaiSublime.jar
  - In Android Studio find Import Settings, load the downloaded file
    - Win/Linux: File / Import Settings
    - Mac: Android Studio / Import Settings
